# 2048 game

A modern implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game built with Flutter. This project enhances the traditional gameplay with smooth animations, an optimized algorithm, and persistent storage using `shared_preferences`.

## Features

-   **Smooth Animations**: Tiles slide and merge with visually appealing transitions.
-   **Optimized Algorithm**: Efficient logic for tile movement, merging, and game state management.
-   **Persistent Storage**: Save and load your high score and game state using `shared_preferences`.
-   **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
-   **Customizable Styling**: Tile colors, text colors, font sizes, and weights adapt dynamically based on tile values
